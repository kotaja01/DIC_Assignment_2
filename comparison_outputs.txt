After we generated the "output_rdd.txt" file, we needed to compare it with the output of the first assignment. What we noticed is that there were noticeable differences in the outputs, even though, in essence, we are doing the same task differently. For example, the terms were ranked quite differently in their respective categories, which indicates that the Chi-Squared Scores have a noticeable difference. At first, we were wondering why that could be, and we remembered that in our Assignment 2 Part 1 script, we filter out terms that occur only once, as this decreased the runtime. We thought that this might cause the discrepancies between the scores, so we did a run without the filtering and got the exact same output as with the filtering. Therefore, this was not the cause. 
Then we noticed, although the Chi Score were different, most of the terms present for a category in the first output were also present in the second (although often with a different ranking). From all of this, we assume the discrepancies arise from implementation-level differences between MapReduce and Spark. 
Therefore, we believe that the essential objective of the first exercise has been kept in our implementation for the second assignment.
